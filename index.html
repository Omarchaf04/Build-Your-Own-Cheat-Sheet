        <tr>
            <td>The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color</td>

            <td>The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</td>

            <td>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element. Let's explore margins first</td>

            <td>The CSS text module defines how to perform text manipulation, like line breaking, justification and alignment, white space handling, and text transformation</td>

            <td>The CSS fonts module defines font-related properties and how font resources are loaded. It lets you define the style of a font, such as its family, size and weight, and the glyph variants to use when multiple are available for a single character</td>
